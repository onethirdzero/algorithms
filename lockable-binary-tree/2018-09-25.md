# Lockable Binary Trees

“Daily Coding Problem #23

This problem was asked by Google.

Implement locking in a binary tree. A binary tree node can be locked or unlocked only if all of its descendants or ancestors are not locked.

Design a binary tree node class with the following methods:

* `is_locked`, which returns whether the node is locked
* `lock`, which attempts to lock the node. If it cannot be locked, then it should return false. Otherwise, it should lock it and return true.
* `unlock`, which unlocks the node. If it cannot be unlocked, then it should return false. Otherwise, it should unlock it and return true.

You may augment the node to add parent pointers or any other property you would like. You may assume the class is used in a single-threaded program, so there is no need for actual locks or mutexes. Each method should run in O(h), where h is the height of the tree.”

## Prior Attempt

### Algorithm

* Check if any node in the BT is locked
* If so, return false
* Otherwise, lock/unlock the current node

### Analysis

* Since this approach visits every node in the BT, it runs in `O(n)` time
* Uses `O(1)` space, since no extra data structures are required

### Comments

* I could only think of a `O(n)` method because I misunderstood the definition of ancestors - I thought it included uncles/siblings of parents
* So, it’s important to clarify every definition in the problem

## Solution

* [Lockable Binary Trees · Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/blog/lockable-binary-trees/)

### Algorithm

* Check if we can lock/unlock
	* If current node’s locked descendants count > 0, return false
	* If any ancestors are locked, return false
* Lock/unlock current node
* Update ancestors with new locked descendants count

```py
class LockableBTNode:
	def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None, parent=None):
		self.val = val
		self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.parent = parent
        self.locked_descendants_count = 0
        self._is_locked = False

    def is_locked(self):
        return self._is_locked = False

    def _can_be_locked_or_unlocked(self):
        if self.locked_descendants_count > 0:
            return False

        # Check ancestors.
        curr = self.parent
        while curr is not None:
            if curr.is_locked():
                return False
            curr = curr.parent

        return True

    def lock(self):
        if not self._can_be_locked_or_unlocked():
            return False

        self._is_locked = True

        # Update ancestors.
        curr = self.parent
        while curr is not None:
            curr.locked_descendants_count += 1
            curr = curr.parent

        return True

    def unlock(self):
        if not self._can_be_locked_or_unlocked():
            return False

        self._is_locked = False

        # Update ancestors.
        curr = self.parent
        while curr is not None:
            curr.locked_descendants_count -= 1
            curr = curr.parent

        return True
```

### Analysis

* Without the `locked_descendants_count` attribute, we would need to check all `m` descendants to see if any are locked, giving us a `O(m)` running time
	* Since we do have that, that work is reduced to `O(1)`
* After that, checking each ancestor for a lock is done in `O(d)`, where `d` is the depth of the node we want to lock/unlock - `d <= h`
* Therefore, locking/unlocking runs in `O(h + 1)` time -> `O(h)`

* We don’t require any extra data structures, so we use `O(1)` space
