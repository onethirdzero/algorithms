# Find Arbitrage

“Daily Coding Problem #32

This problem was asked by Jane Street.

Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a 2D array. Determine whether there is a possible arbitrage: that is, whether there is some sequence of trades you can make, starting with some amount A of any currency, so that you can end up with some amount greater than A of that currency.

There are no transaction costs and you can trade fractional quantities.”

## Prior Attempt

### Algorithm

* For each exchange rate
	* Find all occurrences of the current rate
	* For all of these occurrences
		* Keep trading until we arrive back to the currency we started with
		* If the return > initial investment
			* Return true
* Return false

### Comments

* To guarantee that we try all possible trades of a given rate, maybe we could track previously used rates in each transaction
* Wasn't sure how to determine running time beyond the `O(n)` for iterating through every given exchange rate
* Wasn't sure how to calculate number of cycles found in the exploratory trading section

## Solution

* [How To Find Arbitrage Opportunities In Python · Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/blog/how-to-find-arbitrage-opportunities-in-python/)

* We can think of the currencies as vertices and the exchange rates as weighted edges between them
* In a real-world exchange, we can exchange any currency for any other one - so this means our graph is completely connected
* Since we want to compare our initial investment to the eventual return, this implies finding cycles and calculating their edge weight products
* If the edge weight product is  greater than 1, we have a positive return on investment - because math?

* Brute forcing this for every vertex is really slow
* We can reduce the problem into something that's faster than brute force
* If we take the negative log of the weights, the problem of looking for edge weight products greater than 1 turns into the problem looking for negative cycles - and we know a good polynomial-time algorithm for this, the Bellman-Ford

* eg. Given an edge path: `a -> b -> c -> d`
* Taking the negative log: `-log(a) -> -log(b) -> -log(c) -> -log(d)`
* Then taking the sum of these weights to determine the path's distance/cost:
```
-log(a) + -log(b) + -log(c) + -log(d)
= -(log(a) + log(b) + log(c) + log(d))
= -(log(a * b * c * d))
= -log(x) where x = (a * b * c * d)
```
* `-log(x) < 0` only if `x > 1`, so if we find a negative cycle, it's equivalent to finding a path whose edge weight product is greater than 1
* All we need to do is run the Bellman-Ford on this graph and return true if a negative cycle is found

### Algorithm

* Instantiate a complete connected graph
* Take the negative log of the edge weights and relabel them accordingly
* Run a Bellman-Ford search
	*  If there is a negative cycle, return true
* Return false

### Analysis

* The Bellman-Ford algorithm runs in `O(V * E)` time
* The transformed graph with negative log weights takes `O(n^2)` space

### Comments

* I arrived at similar conclusions that the problem could be modelled as a complete connected graph and the bulk of the work would be finding edge products of cycles - but didn't know how to proceed beyond that

* The solution doesn't seem to attempt to trade fractional quantities - is it a given that it's ineffective?

* The brute force approach has to traverse permutations of varying length among the `|V| - 1` remaining vertices, for a given vertex
* It has to do this this for all `V` vertices - thus, it runs in `O(n!)` time - not sure about the exact running time
