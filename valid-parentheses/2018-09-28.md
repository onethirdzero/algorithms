# Valid Parentheses

* [Valid Parentheses - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/)

## Solution

### Algorithm

* Initialize a stack
* For each `c` in string
	* If `c` is an opening bracket, push it to the stack
	* Else
		* Pop off the stack and compare
		* If the brace types don’t match, return false
* If stack is not empty, return false
* Return true

### Analysis

* Runs in `O(n)` time, since we visit every character once
* Uses `O(n)` space, since in the worst case, we’d store only opening braces and not find any closing braces

### Comments

* Actually remembered to clarify the constraints of the problem this time
* This was simpler than I thought - I was expecting some weird edge case to invalidate my attempt

## Nearly O(1) Space Approach

* https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/discuss/175160/Java-solution-with-O(1)-space-to-simulate-a-stack-by-2-pointers

### Algorithm

* Use an index `i = -1` to simulate a stack
* For `j=0..len(A)`
	* If `i == -1` or if `A[i]` and `A[j]` don’t match
		* Increment `i` and write `A[j]` to it - ‘push to the stack’
	* Else
		* Decrement `i` - ‘pop off the stack’
	* Increment `j`
* Return `i == -1`

```py
def isValid(s)
    i = -1
    j = 0
    A = list(s)

    while j < len(A):
        if i == -1 or not match(A, i, j):
            # Push to stack.
            i += 1
            A[i] = A[j]
        else:
            # Pop from stack.
            i -= 1
        j += 1

    return i == -1

def match(A, i, j):
    if A[i] == '(' and A[j] == ')':
        return True
    elif A[i] == '{' and A[j] == '}':
        return True
    elif A[i] == '[' and A[j] == ']':
        return True
    return False
```

### Analysis

* Runs in `O(n)` time, since `j` moves forward on each iteration
* Uses `O(1)` space if we don’t count casting `s` to a list/array
	* I don’t know how much casting costs in the real world, but I’d imagine we’d need to allocate new memory for the new data type anyway, so it would probably end up non-negligible

### Comments

* The clever part about `A[i] = A[j]` is preserving the last seen opening braces
* We don’t worry about overwriting previous elements because we’re confident that we’ve closed all intermediate braces between `i` and `j` - also remember that we only need to validate the string, not preserve it
