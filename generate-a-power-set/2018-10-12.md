# Generate a Power Set

“Daily Coding Problem #37

This problem was asked by Google.

The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. Write a function that, given a set, generates its power set.

For example, given the set {1, 2, 3}, it should return {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}.”

## Solution

* [Finding all subsets of a given set in Java - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/finding-all-subsets-of-a-given-set-in-java/)

* The size of the power set is `2 ^ size of the original set`
* If we enumerate all values of the power set, we notice that there’s a mapping between binary strings `0..size of power set`

* eg. `A = {a, b, c}`
```
000	{}
001	{c}
010	{b}
011	{b, c}
100	{a}
101	{a, c}
110	{a, b}
111	{a, b, c}
```

* Each `1` indicates that the corresponding element in the original set is included in the current subset
* This means we can use the binary strings to determine which elements to pull from `A` to generate its subsets

### Algorithm

* For `i=0..size of power set`
	* For `j=0..size of original set`
		* If `j`th bit is set on the binary string of `i`
			* Add `A[j]` to the current subset
	* Add current subset to result
* Return result

### Analysis

* To construct each subset, we consider `size of A` elements - let’s call that number `n`
* We do this for all elements of the power set, `2 ^ n` - therefore, this runs in `O(n2^2)` time

* This uses `O(2^n)` space to store the result array

### Comments

* I learned about bit shifting through this solution
* A left shift raises the value of the binary string by `2`, while a right shift does the opposite

* To check if a bit was set - ie. was equal to `1` - we AND that bit with a `1`
	* `1 AND 1 = 1`
	* `0 AND 1 = 0`
	* So this just tells us what bit’s the original value was
* With this, we can check if the `j`th bit on `i` was set by AND-ing the `j`th bit with a `1`
* We do this by left shifting the binary string of a `1` `j` times, then just AND-ing the two binary strings:
```
    10011101   10010101
AND 00001000   00001000
  = 00001000   00000000
```

* I think this handles duplicates as well
