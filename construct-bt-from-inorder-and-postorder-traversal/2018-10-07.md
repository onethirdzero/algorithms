# Construct BT From Preorder and Inorder Traversal

* [Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/description/)

## Recursive Approach

* [Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/discuss/34579/Python-short-recursive-solution.)

### Analysis

* Runs in `O(n)` time because every element in the preorder traversal is visited only once
* No extra space is used here apart from the recursion stack - `O(1)`?

###  Comments

* Takes advantage of the fact that in the inorder traversal, the left and right subtrees of any given node are adjacent to it - ie. the subarrays adjacent to an element represent subtrees rooted at its children

## Iterative Approach

* [Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/discuss/34555/The-iterative-solution-is-easier-than-you-think!)

### Comments
* Harder to follow than the recursive approach - it takes advantage of certain properties between the preorder and inorder traversals - but I donâ€™t know what yet
