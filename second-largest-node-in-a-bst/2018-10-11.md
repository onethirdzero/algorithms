# Second Largest Node in a BST

“Daily Coding Problem #36

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Given the root to a binary search tree, find the second largest node in the tree.”

## Prior Attempt

### Algorithm

* If right child does not exist
	* Return left child as the second largest
* Else
	* Find the rightmost node
	* Return its parent as the second largest

### Analysis

* Runs in `O(log n)`, since the second largest node could be at `n - 1` depth
* Uses `O(1)` space, since we don’t grow any data structures

### Comments

* This assumes a balanced BST - so if the right child does not exist, the subtree rooted at the left child should never be taller than height `1`
* So, the largest tree where the right child of the root doesn’t exist looks like:
```
  2
 /
1
```
* This imbalance should never happen:
```
    3
   /
  2
 /
1
```
* Because given those elements, a balanced BST should look like:
```
  2
 / \
1   3
```

* So if a right child does exist, then the rightmost node’s parent will be the second largest element

## Solution

* Reference: [algorithm - Second max in BST - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11425352/second-max-in-bst)

* The assumptions made in my prior attempt are overly optimistic
* The interviewer could also ask me to solve for an unbalanced BST
* In that case, we’ll modify the 2 cases we considered

* Since this is a BST, the rightmost node is the largest node
* There are 2 possibilities - either the rightmost node has a subtree rooted at its left child or it doesn’t
* If the left child exists, then the rightmost node of that subtree is the second largest
* Otherwise, the parent of the original rightmost node is the second largest

### Algorithm

* Find the rightmost node
* If the rightmost node has a left child
	* Return the rightmost node of the subtree rooted at the left child
* Else
	* Return the rightmost node’s parent

### Analysis

* Runs in `O(log n)` time, since the second largest node could be at `n - 1` depth
* Uses `O(1)` space, since we don’t grow any data structures

### Comments

* I didn’t arrive at this solution because I was too conservative about my assumptions
* In an interview, anything is possible, so I should try not to avoid harder problems by making cheap assumptions
