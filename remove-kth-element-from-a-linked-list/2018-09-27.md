# Remove kth Last Element From a Linked List

“Daily Coding Problem #26

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a singly linked list and an integer k, remove the kth last element from the list. k is guaranteed to be smaller than the length of the list.

The list is very long, so making more than one pass is prohibitively expensive.

Do this in constant space and in one pass.”

## Solution

### Algorithm

* Send a lookahead pointer `k` steps ahead
* Initialize a `prev` pointer that’s 1 step behind the `curr` pointer
* Increment the lookahead, `prev` and `curr` simultaneously until lookup is at the last node in the list
* Remove `curr`

```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

class Solution:
	def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, k):
		"""
		:type head: ListNode
		:type n: int
		:rtype: ListNode
		"""
		# If length of list is 1, we can't remove anything.
		if head.next is None:
			return head

		i = 0
		curr = lookahead = head
		prev = None

		# Send a lookahead pointer k steps ahead.
		while i != k:
			lookahead = lookahead.next
			i += 1

		# Increment lookahead, prev and curr simultaneously until lookahead is at last node.
		while lookahead is not None:
			lookahead = lookahead.next
			prev = curr
			curr = curr.next

		# Remove kth last element.
		prev.next = curr.next
		del curr

		return head
```

### Analysis

* Runs in `O(n)` time, since we do only a single pass on every node
* Uses `O(1)` space, since we don’t grow any data structures with each iteration

### Comments

* An important criterion here is: ‘k is guaranteed to be smaller than the length of the list’
	* This implies that we can never return the head of the list, otherwise that would be `k == len(list)`
	* This also implies that if we get a list of length 1, we can’t remove anything ie. `k = 0` - hence the line: `if head.next is None: return head`
* This is different from the variation available on LeetCode: [Remove Nth Node From End of List - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/)
	* This variation allows `1 <= k <= len(list)`, so that makes for trickier edge cases:
		* `[1, 2], k=2` - Remove head
		* `[1], k=1` - Remove head

* The beauty of using the lookahead is that it maintains a length `k` interval between itself and `curr` - if we shift the lookahead to the tail, then we get `curr` as the `k`th last element
```
head                                          tail
|-----------------------------------------------|
curr              lookahead
|---------------------|

head                                          tail
|-----------------------------------------------|
                         curr              lookahead
                          |---------------------|
```

* Raj had went through this question with me before - he said the lookahead was a common pattern in linked list problems

* The two pass approach also uses constant space, but takes nearly twice as long to run - could start with that so that this solution can be introduced as an optimization
