# Run-Length Encoding and Decoding

“Daily Coding Problem #29

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and character. For example, the string "AAAABBBCCDAA" would be encoded as "4A3B2C1D2A".

Implement run-length encoding and decoding. You can assume the string to be encoded have no digits and consists solely of alphabetic characters. You can assume the string to be decoded is valid.”

## Solution

### Algorithm

* Encode
* For each char
	* If char’s value matches buffer value
		* Read char into buffer
	* Else
		* Encode buffer contents and append to result
		* Clear buffer and add current char
* If buffer is not empty
	* Encode buffer contents and append to result
* Return result

* Decode
* For each char
	* If int buffer is filled and char buffer is filled
		* Decode buffer contents and append to result
		* Clear buffers
	* If char is parsed as int and int buffer is empty
		* Cast char to int and write it to the int buffer
	* Else if char is a valid char and char buffer is empty
		* Write current char to char buffer
* If int buffer is filled and char buffer is filled
	* Decode buffer contents and append to result
* Return result

```py
class Solution:
	def encode(self, s):
		# Base cases.
		if len(s) == 0: return ''
		if len(s) == 1: return '1' + s

		buff = []
		res = []
		for c in s:
			# Initial step.
			if len(buff) == 0:
				buff.append(c)
			# If new char matches buffer contents.
			elif c == buff[0]:
				buff.append(c)
			else:
				# Add our current buffer contents
				# to the result.
				res.append(str(len(buff)) + buff[0])

				# Clear the buffer and add the new char.
				buff = []
				buff.append(c)

		# Final chunk that didn't get encoded.
		if len(buff) > 0:
			res.append(str(len(buff)) + buff[0])

		return ''.join(res)

	def decode(self, s):
		int_buff = -1
		char_buff = ''
		res = []

		for c in s:
			if int_buff > 0 and char_buff is not '':
				# Decode chunk and add to result.
				res.append(int_buff * char_buff)

				# Clear buffers.
				char_buff = ''
				int_buff = -1

			if self._is_int(c) and int_buff < 0:
				int_buff = int(c)
			elif isinstance(c, str) and char_buff is '':
				char_buff = c

		# Final chunk that didn't get decoded.
		if int_buff > 0 and char_buff is not '':
			# Decode chunk and add to result.
			res.append(int_buff * char_buff)

		return ''.join(res)

	def _is_int(self, c):
		try:
			ret = int(c)
			return True
		except ValueError:
			return False
```

### Analysis

* Both encode and decode runs in `O(n)` time, since each character is visited once

* Encode uses `O(n)` space for a string with only 1 unique character
    * Could use a counter instead of a buffer for `O(1)` space
* Decode uses `O(m)` space where `m` is the size of the result string/array

### Comments

* The problem assures us that we can assume valid input to both methods, but in the real-world it’s better to handle invalid cases just to be safe
