# Odd Even Linked List

* https://www.programcreek.com/2015/03/leetcode-odd-even-linked-list-java/

“Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.

The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.

Example:
Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL,
return 1->3->5->2->4->NULL.
“

## Prior Attempt

### Algorithm

* If linked list is empty, return None
* Traverse the linked list
* At each node
	* Check a flag to see if it’s an even or odd node
	* Create a new node and append it to the appropriate auxiliary linked list
* Point the tail of the odds linked list to the head of the evens linked list
* Return the head of the odds linked list

### Complexity

* Runs in `O(n)` time
* Uses `O(n)` space

## Solution

### Algorithm

* If `A` is empty, return None
* If `A` is length-1, return `A`
* Traverse the linked list with 2 pointers, `even` and `odd`
* While `even` and `odd` are not None
	* If `even.next` is None, break
	* Point `odd.next` at `even.next`
	* Move `odd` at `odd.next`
	* Point `even.next` at `odd.next`
	* Move `even` to `even.next`
* Return `A`

### Complexity

* Runs in `O(n)` time
* Uses `O(1)` space
