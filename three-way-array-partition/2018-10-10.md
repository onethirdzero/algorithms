# 3-Way Array Partition

“Daily Coding Problem #35

This problem was asked by Google.

Given an array of strictly the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B', segregate the values of the array so that all the Rs come first, the Gs come second, and the Bs come last. You can only swap elements of the array.

Do this in linear time and in-place.

For example, given the array ['G', 'B', 'R', 'R', 'B', 'R', 'G'], it should become ['R', 'R', 'R', 'G', 'G', 'B', 'B'].“

## Prior Attempt

### Algorithm

* Let `l = 0` and `r = 1`
* While `l < len(A)`
	* If `A[l]` is ‘B’ and `A[r]` is not ‘B’
		* Swap `A[l]` and `A[r]`
		* Increment `l` and `r`
	* Else if `A[r]` is ‘R’ and `A[l]` is not ‘R’
		* Swap `A[l]` and `A[r]`
		* Increment `l` and `r`
	* Else
		* If `r < len(A)`
			* Increment `r`
		* Else
			* Increment `l`
			* `l = r + 1`

### Comments

* This would be broken by this edge case:
```
[B, G, R] # l = 0, r = 0
[G, B, R] # l = 1, r = 2
[G, R, B] # l = 2, r = 3
```
* After the first iteration, we lose our reference to index `0`, which is where ‘R’ needs to be swapped to

* Evidently, more than 2 pointers was necessary, but I wasn’t sure how to proceed from there

## Solution

* [Dutch national flag problem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem)

* The idea is to have a pointer that tracks the boundary of the partition for each character
* Using the middle pointer (corresponding to G, in this case) as the ‘traversal’ pointer, we examine its element on each iteration to determine whether or not to swap it
* As the middle pointer advances in the array, the other partitions grow as the correct characters get swapped into their partition

### Algorithm

* Let `l = m = 0` and `r = len(A) -1`
* While `m <= r`
	* If `A[m]` is a ‘R’
		* Swap `A[m]` and `A[l]`
		* Increment `m` and `l`
	* Else if `A[m]` is a ‘B’
		* Swap `A[m]` and `A[r]`
		* Decrement `r`
	* Else
		* Increment `m`

### Analysis

* In the worst case, `m` visits every element and swaps with `l` each time
	* Or `m` swaps with `r` each time and `r` visits every element
* This runs in `O(n)` time
* This uses `O(1)` space, since the swapping is done in-place

### Comments

* If we wanted to generalize for `n` partitions, we can partition for the leftmost character first (eg. ‘R’) and use the end index of that partition as the start index of the next intended partition - in other words, we’d just repeat the partitioning process, but starting at this index

* I’d imagine this would take more than a single pass, but would still be in the order of `O(n)`
